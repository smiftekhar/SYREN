This README is intended to give an overview of the organizational
structure of the SYREN implementation as well as  
how to compile and run the application,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Organizational Structure and Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYREN is made up of two separate pieces: one mote application (which can
 be configured for base station and regular motes by modifying Makefile)
 and one java based application to interact with the base station mote.
The code for all three applications is divided up 
among two directories: SYRENController and SerialMessenger.

The code specific to the mote is contained under
the 'SYRENController' directory, and code for the java 
application is found in the 'SerialMessenger.

The SYRENController application is needed to be installed on 
all the motes. The base station mote will be connected to a serial port 
of a laptop/computer. That laptop/computer will run the java application 
'SerialMessenger' which communicate the basestation through serial port. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation Instructions and Running the Applications
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the instructions to compile and install the whole program:
1. To configure the mote as base station: 
Go to the SYRENController directory and give the following commands.
 i. Add CFLAGS += BASESTATION in the Makefile
 ii. make telosb
 iii. make telosb reinstall make telosb reinstall.1 bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0 
 
2. To configure the mote as regular one:
Go to the SYRENController directory and give the following commands.
 i. make telosb reinstall 
 ii. make telosb reinstall make telosb reinstall.<MOTE_ID_OTHER_THAN_1> bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0

3. To compile SerialMessenger application:
Go to the SerialMessenger/src directory and give the following commands.
  i. javac -d ../bin SerialMessenger.java
 
Here are the instruction to run the program:

After connecting the base station mote to the laptop, run the serial messenger application:
Go to the SerialMessenger/bin directory and give the following commands.
  i. java SerialMessenger <SERIAL_PORT_NAME> (e.g. java SerialMessenger /dev/ttyUSB0)
  ii. A GUI will come up. Click 'Run Concurrently' to start the application.
